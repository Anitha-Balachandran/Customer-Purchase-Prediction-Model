# Customer-Purchase-Prediction-Model


## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using the Black Friday dataset to forecast customer purchase amounts based on demographics, product preferences, and historical behavior. By accurately predicting the purchase amount, the model provides insights into customer spending patterns, which can be used to enable the creation of personalized offers and recommendations that can be presented to customers before they complete their checkout process. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to enhance customer engagement and increase sales through targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Black Friday Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdolezel/black-friday), which includes customer demographics and purchase information.
